Chi-square statistics were computed to determine significant associations and correlation was used to determine the relationship between the knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding. P value was set at 0.05 significant level.

**RESULT**: In this study, most of the respondents were aware of exclusive breastfeeding (92%),53.5% were currently practising exclusive breastfeeding, 48% were able to sustain exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months,34.5% reported that they were currently facing challenges breastfeeding exclusively at the time of the study,48.5 reported that it was challenging for them to exclusively breastfeed,49.5% reported that breastfeeding is embarrassing and outdated and shouldn't be public,71.5% reported that they felt pain while breastfeeding,53% reported that they did not make the decision to exclusively breastfeed by themselves,65% reported that exclusive breastfeeding is not necessary,46% said they would suggest breastfeeding to other mothers.

s on addressing the challenges that mothers face, such as pain while breastfeeding, the perception that exclusive breastfeeding is not necessary, and the stigma associated with breastfeeding in public. Additionally, interventions should educate mothers about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and provide them with the support they need to overcome the challenges they face.
