## ASSESSMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING AMONGST GENERATION Z MOTHERS IN SURULERE, LGA LAGOS STATE.

### **INTRODUCTION**
Breastfeeding is a crucial practice for infant health, providing essential nutrients, antibodies, and fostering a strong bond between mother and child. It is recommended by global health organizations for the first six months. However, despite its benefits, global breastfeeding practices deviate from recommendations, with challenges observed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, exclusive breastfeeding rates are low, as just 29% of infants under six months adhere to this practice. Notably, breastfeeding has been associated with various health benefits for both mothers and infants, including lower risk of breast cancer for mothers. It is crucial to discourage the early introduction of liquids other than breast milk to ensure optimal health outcomes for infants.

 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Low uptake of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) contributes to 11.6% of Under-5 fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa. EBF prevalence varies across regions, with Nigeria reporting only 17.5%, far below the recommended 60% by WHO and UNICEF. Underlying factors, including maternal characteristics and lack of breastfeeding education, contribute to suboptimal EBF practices. Limited research in Lagos and semi-urban areas highlights the need for a study to assess EBF prevalence and correlates. Achieving global goals, particularly SDGs related to health and nutrition, requires promoting optimal breastfeeding practices. This study in Surulere LGA aims to address these gaps and contribute valuable data for national breastfeeding improvement strategies.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY

This study aims to highlight the government's role in educating Generation Z mothers (ages 18-27) on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding. By emphasizing the benefits of this practice, the research seeks to inform and educate the public, particularly women. The study is not only valuable for future researchers but also for policymakers and healthcare professionals aiming to design effective breastfeeding promotion programs. It will contribute to advancing knowledge and serve as a roadmap for future efforts and research in this critical area.

### **ABSTRACT**
**Background**: Despite its benefits and interventions, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is not widely practised, including in Nigeria. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding among Generation Z mothers in Surulere LGA, Lagos state.
**Method**: A study with a cross-sectional design was carried out on 200 women belonging to Generation Z, who are between the ages of 18 and 26 and who attend the four primary health clinics located in Surulere LGA, present during the study period in Lagos. SPSS version 27 was used to analyze the data after it was gathered using a self-structured questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were done with frequencies, percentages, mean and standard deviation. Chi-square statistics were computed to determine significant associations and correlation was used to determine the relationship between the knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding. P value was set at 0.05 significant level.
**Results**: In this study, most of the respondents were aware of exclusive breastfeeding (92%),53.5% were currently practising exclusive breastfeeding, 48% were able to sustain exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months,34.5% reported that they were currently facing challenges breastfeeding exclusively at the time of the study,48.5 reported that it was challenging for them to exclusively breastfeed,49.5% reported that breastfeeding is embarrassing and outdated and shouldn't be public,71.5% reported that they felt pain while breastfeeding,53% reported that they did not make the decision to exclusively breastfeed by themselves,65% reported that exclusive breastfeeding is not necessary,46% said they would suggest breastfeeding to other mothers.
It was further revealed that there was no statistically significance association between age, marital status, educational background and religion with their practice of exclusive breastfeeding while occupation and number of children had a significant association with the practice of exclusive breastfeeding. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between respondentsâ€™ knowledge and the practice of exclusive breastfeeding.
**Conclusion**: The results of this study suggest that there is a need to develop and implement interventions to support Generation Z mothers in practicing exclusive breastfeeding. These interventions should focus.
s on addressing the challenges that mothers face, such as pain while breastfeeding, the perception that exclusive breastfeeding is not necessary, and the stigma associated with breastfeeding in public. Additionally, interventions should educate mothers about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and provide them with the support they need to overcome the challenges they face.
