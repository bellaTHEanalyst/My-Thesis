## ASSESSMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING AMONGST GENERATION Z MOTHERS IN SURULERE, LGA LAGOS STATE.

1.0 **INTRODUCTION**
Breastfeeding is a crucial practice for infant health, providing essential nutrients, antibodies, and fostering a strong bond between mother and child. It is recommended by global health organizations for the first six months. However, despite its benefits, global breastfeeding practices deviate from recommendations, with challenges observed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, exclusive breastfeeding rates are low, as just 29% of infants under six months adhere to this practice. Notably, breastfeeding has been associated with various health benefits for both mothers and infants, including lower risk of breast cancer for mothers. It is crucial to discourage the early introduction of liquids other than breast milk to ensure optimal health outcomes for infants.

1.1 **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM**
Low uptake of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) contributes to 11.6% of Under-5 fatalities in sub-Saharan Africa. EBF prevalence varies across regions, with Nigeria reporting only 17.5%, far below the recommended 60% by WHO and UNICEF. Underlying factors, including maternal characteristics and lack of breastfeeding education, contribute to suboptimal EBF practices. Limited research in Lagos and semi-urban areas highlights the need for a study to assess EBF prevalence and correlates. Achieving global goals, particularly SDGs related to health and nutrition, requires promoting optimal breastfeeding practices. This study in Surulere LGA aims to address these gaps and contribute valuable data for national breastfeeding improvement strategies.

1.2 **SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY**

This study aims to highlight the government's role in educating Generation Z mothers (ages 18-27) on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding. By emphasizing the benefits of this practice, the research seeks to inform and educate the public, particularly women. The study is not only valuable for future researchers but also for policymakers and healthcare professionals aiming to design effective breastfeeding promotion programs. It will contribute to advancing knowledge and serve as a roadmap for future efforts and research in this critical area.
